## DETECTION OF CONE CUT ERRORS IN DENTAL BITEWING RADIOGRAPH USING CNN FOR QUALITY ASSURANCE
Bitewing radiograph is a commonly used technique to detect caries in the interproximal area. This technique is used widely since the beginning year of dental students and dental assistants. It requires a learning curve to get clinically acceptable quality. Common errors in bitewing radiographs among dental students and assistants include cone-cut damaged images. Dental clinics, universities, and hospitals are still struggling to detect tooth problems without X-rays, in contrast to other treatments that utilize different tools and mechanisms to assist them to diagnose the condition without imaging X-rays. This study aims to develop four CNN-8, CNN-14, ResNet20v1 and ResNet50 models to predetermine cone cut errors and ensure proper images before a bitewing radiograph is taken. This is necessary to implement a system that can detect this error, and alert and guide the dental assistants before taking the bitewing radiograph images. The suggested models were trained using a dataset of over 5000 images that were compiled and sorted into two dental X-ray categories, obtaining high accuracy classification models of 94%, 99%, 98% and 47% in four CNN models, respectively.
